Job Portal Documentation
Overview

The Job Portal is a web application designed to facilitate the interaction between job seekers and recruiters. It leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to organize the application's structure, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. The application allows job seekers to register, log in, explore available jobs posted by recruiters, and apply for these jobs. Recruiters, on the other hand, can register, log in, post jobs, and view applications submitted by job seekers. All data inputs are validated using Express Validator to ensure data integrity and security.
Architecture
MVC Pattern

    Model: Represents the data and the rules that govern access to and updates of this data. In the context of the Job Portal, models include User, Job, and Application.
    View: Responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting data to the user. Views in the Job Portal include registration forms, login pages, job listings, and recruiter dashboards.
    Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. Controllers handle user input, interact with the Model, and update the View accordingly. Examples include handling user registration, job posting, and application submissions.

Technologies

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Backend: Node.js, Express.js
    Validation: Express Validator

Features
For Job Seekers

    Registration and Login: Allows job seekers to create an account and log in to the portal.
    Job Exploration: Enables job seekers to browse through various job postings.
    Job Application: Provides functionality for job seekers to apply for jobs they are interested in.

    Applicant Management: Allows recruiters to view and manage applications submitted by job seekers.

Data Validation

All data inputs, including user registration details, job postings, and application submissions, are validated using Express Validator. This ensures that the data meets specific criteria before being processed or stored in the database, enhancing the application's security and reliability.
Security Measures

    Authentication and Authorization: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms and authorization checks to protect user data and ensure only authorized users can access certain features.
    Data Encryption: Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.
    Input Sanitization: Using Express Validator to sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

Development Workflow

    Version Control: Utilizing Git for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.
    Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring the application is always in a deployable state.

Conclusion

The Job Portal is designed to streamline the job-seeking and recruitment process, providing a user-friendly interface for both job seekers and recruiters. By leveraging the MVC architecture, the application ensures a structured and maintainable codebase, while Express Validator enhances data integrity and security.
